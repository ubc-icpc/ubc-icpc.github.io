The UBCPC will be a five hour contest that serves as the UBC tryout of 2020, featuring 8 problems and a range of difficulties. The contest is best suited to strong individual programmers or teams. UBC students in division 1 are asked to participate individually. Everyone is welcome to participate.

<br>

We will be forming Div 2 teams consisting of newcomers to competitive programming as well as Div 1 teams consiting of more experienced programmers. Top performing Div 1 teams in our region will qualify for something (either the North American Championship 2021 or ICPC World Finals 2021).

<br>
We take into account results from this contest, select practices, and <a href="https://codeforces.com" target=_blank>Codeforces</a> rating when making teams. We will rotate and test out teams based on the results of these contests before the regionals.
