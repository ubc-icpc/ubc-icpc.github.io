<h2> About </h2>
<p>
Welcome to the 2019 UBC Programming Contest (UBCPC). 
<br>
<br>
The UBCPC will be a four hour contest that serves as the first UBC tryout of 2019. There are 8 problems and is intended for people of all skill levels. The contest is best suited to strong individual programmers or weaker teams. UBC students are asked to participate individually. Everyone is welcome to participate either onsite or remotely. 
<br>
<br>
There will be a practice round where you can test the accounts and the submission system that will be open on September 28th. The actual contest will start at 1:00pm PDT unless there are onsite delays.

<h2> FAQ </h2>

<b><i>How do I sign up for this contest?</i></b>

Other individuals or teams are also welcome to join on the scoreboard. 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>What languages are supported?</i></b>
<br>
Currently the judge has support for C, C++, Java, Python2 and Python3. Kotlin may be added upon request.

We have tested solutions to all the problems in Java and C++. There are no guarentees for solutions in other languages.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Are contestants allowed reference materials or internet access?</i></b>
<br>
Contestants are permitted to look up documentation for any of the supported languages. You may access any personal code or templates that you have prewritten. Please do not use the internet for anything else.
<br>
Remote participants are requested to follow these rules as well.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Will there be prizes?</i></b>
<br>
 You can get the sense of pride and accomplishment for doing well in the contest. 
</p>
<b><i>What is this tryout for?</i></b>
<br>
  We are forming teams for <a href="http://acmicpc-pacnw.org/">2019 Pacific NW ICPC Regional</a> happening on November 9th. We will be forming Div 2 teams consisting of newcomers to competitive programming as well as Div 1 teams consiting of more experienced programmers. Top performing Div 1 teams in our region will qualify for <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu">ICPC World Finals 2020</a> happening this year in Moscow, Russia.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>How does team selection work?</i></b>
<br>
We take into account results from this contest and the North American Qualifers (NAQ) 2019 that will be happening on Oct. 5th to make teams. We will rotate and test out teams based on the results of these contests before the regionals.
