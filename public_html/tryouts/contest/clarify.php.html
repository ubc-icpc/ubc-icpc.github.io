<i>Java class names?<br />

Please use the following class names (make sure classes are public):<br />

Problem A - public class A { ... }<br />
Problem B - public class B { ... }<br />

Compilers?<br />
<br>
<i>gcc 4.8.1<br />
javac 1.7.0_51<br />
python 2.7.6<br />

<tr><td>E - Palindromic Pokemon</td>
<td>
I'm assuming the code should be printing out the next time that is palindromic? It's never really explicitly stated in the description.<br />
<br>
<i>:)<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>B - Red vs Blue</td>
<td>
Is Blue located on the corner or the edge?<br />
<br>
<i>That depends on where you will move.<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>D - To the PC!</td>
<td>
can we touch c * r region too, or only r * c?<br />
<br>
<i>Only r*c.<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>F - The Final Requirement</td>
<td>
if n = 4,<br />
1 2 3 4<br />
is pairing up 1 with 4 and 2 with 3 considered crossing?<br />
<br>
<i>(Assuming you mean 2n = 4...)<br />
<br />
If the the 4 trainers are ordered cyclically, then there are no crossings for the arrangement <br />
<br />
1   2<br />
|   |<br />
4   3<br />
<br />
Whatever ordering you choose for the numbers does not matter as long as it is consistent throughout your count.<br />

<tr><td>E - Palindromic Pokemon</td>
<td>
What are the limits of t?<br />
<br>
<i>The number of test cases is less than 100.<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>General</td>
<td>
Do not include package declarations in Java submissions!<br />
<br>
<i>Yes!<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>F - The Final Requirement</td>
<td>
I meant for 2n=8 so 4 trainers in each row<br />
<br>
<i>Still no crossing. The people are arranged in a circle, not in two rows.<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>B - Red vs Blue</td>
<td>
Are you sure with the sample output?<br />
I think my code is correct, but my output is YES NO!<br />
<br>
<i>(REDACTED)<br />
<br />
Thanks to this person, we fixed the problem statement :)<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>A - Red in Wanderland</td>
<td>
Can you draw out the grid for the example input? <br />
<br />
I'm having trouble understanding the condition of special terrain populating a column/row.<br />
<br>
<i>....<br />
vv>#<br />
>.>.<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>B - Red vs Blue</td>
<td>
Why does the sample output say "NO YES" when I know it should be "YES NO"?!?<br />
<br>
<i>It is actually "YES NO". We made a mistake writing the sample output to PDF.<br />
<br />
Sorry!<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>E - Palindromic Pokemon</td>
<td>
Do things like 05:15 count as palindromic?<br />
<br>
<i>No, a palindrome reads the same forward and backwards. E.g. 11:11 is a palindrome, but 05:15 is not.<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>C - Lt. Surge's New Puzzle</td>
<td>
What does Incorrect Output mean for C?<br />
<br>
<i>It means your solution either: (a) took too many operations, (b) gave the wrong matching of wires to switches, or (c) gave a wire that was out of bounds.<br />
</i></td>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>C - Lt. Surge's New Puzzle</td>
<td>
Can I flip 2 or more switches at once? If so, how?<br />
<br>
<i>You can only flip 1 switch with each operation. To flip 2 switches, you need to send 2 separate FLIP operations.<br />
</i></td>
