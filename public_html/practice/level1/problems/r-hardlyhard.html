<h1>HARDLY HARD</h1>
</center>

<p>You have been given the task of cutting out a quadrilateral slice of cake out
of a larger, rectangular cake. You must find the slice with the smallest
perimeter that satisfies the following constraints.

<img align=right src="images/p7_0.png">

If the cake is of size 10000-by-10000 units and is represented using the first
quadrant of the Cartesian plane, then your slice is quadrilateral ABCD (see figure).
Points A and B are fixed and will be given to you. Also, A,B will lie on a negatively sloping line.
Furthermore, points C and D must lie on the positive y-axis and positive x-axis
respectively, but it is up to you to determine where these two points should be.
A,B,C,D will be distinct points.</p>

<p>Output the minimum perimeter of your slice of cake.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line you will be given <em>n</em> (1 &le; <em>n</em> &le; 100),
the number of test cases. The following <em>n</em> lines each contain
<em>ax ay bx by</em> (0 &lt; <em>ax, ay, bx, by</em> &le; 10000.0),
the coordinates of points A and B respectively.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the perimeter accurate to 3 decimal places on
its own line.</p>

<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
1
3.0 1.0 1.0 2.0
</pre>

<h2>Output for the Sample Input</h2>
<pre>
7.236
