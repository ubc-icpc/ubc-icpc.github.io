<h2>Problem A: Rhombinoes</h2>

<p><img src="qfTxN.png" align="right" width="200" /></p>

<p>In the game of <em>Rhombinoes</em>, you have a board made up entirely of equilateral trianges (see the image), some of which are <em>"live"</em> and some are <em>"dead"</em>. Your goal is to place down as many rhombinoes ("rhombus"-shaped pieces) as possible on the board. Each rhombino should exactly cover two "adjacent" <em>live</em> triangles that have a common side, and no two rhombinoes can use the same triangle.</p>

<p>Given the description of the <em>live</em> and <em>dead</em> triangles of a Rhombino board, what is the maximum number of rhombinoes you can simultaneously place down on the board?</p>

<h3>Description of Board</h3>

<p>Each triangle in the board has a pair of coordinates <em>(x, y)</em>. The bottom-left triangle has coordinates <em>(0, 0)</em> and will always be a triangle with its tip pointed upward. For any given triangle with coordinates <em>(x, y)</em>, the triangle adjacent to it on its right-side (if any) has coordinates <em>(x+1, y)</em>, and the triangle adjacent to it on its top-side (if any) has coordinates <em>(x, y+1)</em>. Left-side and bottom-side adjacency are defined similarly.</p>

<p>Each board has  a width <em>W</em> and a height <em>H</em>. A board with width <em>W</em> and height <em>H</em> is the board which consists of all triangles with coordinates <em>(x, y)</em> such that <em>0 &leq; x &lt; W</em> and <em>0 &leq; y &lt; H</em>. For example, the game board in the image has width <em>6</em> and height <em>3</em>.</p>

<p><em>(See the image for clarification.)</em></p>

<h3>Input Description</h3>

<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated integers <em>W</em>, <em>H</em>, and <em>K</em>.</p>

<p><em>W</em> is the width of the board, <em>H</em> is the height, and <em>K</em> is the number of dead triangles on the board (<em>1 &leq; W &leq; 100</em>, <em>1 &leq; H &leq; 100</em>, <em>1 &leq; K &leq; W*H &leq; 1000</em>).</p>

<p>Exactly <em>K</em> lines will follow. Each such line will contain a pair of space-separated integers <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (<em>0 &leq; x &lt; W, 0 &leq; y &lt; H</em>), indicating that the triangle with coordinates <em>(x,y)</em> is a <em>dead</em> triangle. All other triangles are <em>live</em>.</p>

<h3>Output Description</h3>

<p>Output a line containing a single integer, the maximum number of rhombinoes you can simultaneously place down on the board.</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<h3>Explanation of Sample Input</h3>

<p>This is the board in the image, with cells <em>(1, 1)</em>, <em>(2, 2)</em>, <em>(4, 1)</em>, and <em>(3, 0)</em> dead.</p>
