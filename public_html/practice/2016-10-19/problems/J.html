<h2>Problem J: Logo</h2>

Logo is a programming language built around a turtle. Commands in the
language cause the turtle to move. The turtle has a pen attached to it.
As the turtle moves, it draw lines on the page. The turtle can be programmed
to draw interesting pictures.
<p>
We are interested in making the turtle draw a picture, then return to
the point that it started from. For example, we could give the turtle
the following program:
<p>
<tt>fd 100 lt 120 fd 100 lt 120 fd 100</tt>
<p>
The command <tt>fd</tt> causes the turtle to move forward by the
specified number of units. The command <tt>lt</tt> causes the turtle to
turn left by the specified number of degrees. Thus the above commands
cause the turtle to draw an equilateral triangle with sides 100 units
long. Notice that after executing the commands, the turtle ends up
in the same place as it started. The turtle understands
two additional commands.
The command <tt>bk</tt> causes the turtle to move backward by the
specified number of units. The command <tt>rt</tt> causes the turtle to
turn right by the specified number of degrees.
<p>
After executing many commands, the turtle can get lost, far away from
its starting position. Your task is to determine the straight-line
distance from the turtle's position at the end of its journey
back to the position that it started from.

<h3>Input Specification</h3>
The first line of input contains one integer specifying the number of
test cases to follow. Each test case starts with a line containing
one integer, the number of commands to follow. The commands follow,
one on each line. Each test case will contain no more than 1000 commands.

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
1
5
fd 100
lt 120
fd 100
lt 120
fd 100
</pre>

<h3>Output Specification</h3>
For each test case, output a line containing a single integer,
the distance rounded to the nearest unit.
